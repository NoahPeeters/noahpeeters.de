        <description>Sadly, the LGBTQIA+ community is not yet fully accepted in many parts of the world. To create visibility in societies, different events and celebration dates have been created by and for the community all over the world.
Now, as many people as possible must know about these days. Therefore, I created and maintain a calendar subscription that can be imported or subscribed to in all modern calendar applications.
So please consider using a calendar subscription like the one I provided here &amp;ndash; even if you don&amp;rsquo;t consider yourself as part of the community &amp;ndash; to remind yourself of all the awesome days in the year we can celebrate and the hate members of the LGBTQIA+ community have to withstand daily.</description>
