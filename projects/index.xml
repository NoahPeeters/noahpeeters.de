It is the only python package I&amp;rsquo;ve ever published.
At that time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about parsers or how to create them. So this project was a fun way to expore them.
An important disclaimer: I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend using this package in a projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
