<span><span>Projects</span></span></p><h1>Projects</h1></header><p>During the last years, I worked on <em>a lot</em> of small and personal projects. While these projects were mostly insignificant for others, working on them tought me a lot and helped me become the person I am today.</p><p>Most of my projects are lost in the void of forgotton hard drives. Sometimes, when I remember one of my very old projects, I&rsquo;m a bit sad that I don&rsquo;t have them anymore. Not that I would need them or would reuse parts of them. Most of them were from a time before I know anything about <em>software quality</em>. But I&rsquo;m interested at how I approached solving issues back then. Just to see where I started and where I am now.</p><p>That being sad, I collected some of my projects below. I also included projects I worked on for work.</p><div class=list__item><h3><a href=https://noahpeeters.de/projects/programming/frenet-funk/>freenet FUNK</a></h3></div><div class=list__item><h3><a href=https://noahpeeters.de/projects/programming/pymathexpression/>PyMathExpressions</a></h3>Python library for parsing and calculating expressions</div><div class=list__item><h3><a href=https://noahpeeters.de/projects/programming/wobbly_tower/>Wobbly Tower</a></h3>Mobile iOS game using tetrominos</div></div></article><footer><hr><div class=legal_links><a href=/privacy>Privacy Policy</a>
