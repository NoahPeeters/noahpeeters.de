The battery has a built-in BLE (Bluetooth low energy) module so that one can install the app of the vendor to get some information like the voltage or the current load as well as some other information.
I was thinking of creating some kind of monitoring system based on an Arduino or Raspberry. For that, I first wanted to have a look at how the data is transmitted to the app so that I could reimplement this.</description><dc:creator>Noah Peeters</dc:creator><category>reverse engineering</category></item></channel></rss>
