description: "Short update about the redesign of my website"

As I no longer was a fan of the old design of the website, I created my own, custom, and -- most importantly -- new design. Because I use git and GitHub to manage the source of my website, you can find the old code [in the repository](https://github.com/noahPeeters/noahpeeters.de).

I also used this as a chance to cleanup the content a bit. For example, I removed the tag system because I didn't really used it and had at most two entries per tag. So they didn't had any benefits and only cluttered the UI.

I hope I migrated everything properly and all old links are still intact.
