Hello there :wave:

You seem to have stumbled across my humble website.
Since you are already here, I can quickly show you around:

### [Blog](/posts)

Whenever I create or find something interesting and think it could be interesting for others as well, I create somthing like a blogpost.

### [Publications](/publication)

During my career, I had the chance to write some papers. I published all of them here in case someone finds them usefull.

### [Projects](/projects)

A collection of personal projects from the past I still like to think about sometimes...

### [Curriculum Vitae](/cv)

If you want to find out more about myself, I published my cv here. There you also find a lot of options to contact me.



### [Source Code](https://github.com/NoahPeeters/noahpeeters.de)

I created this webpage using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and published the source code on GitHub. In case you want to reuse any of the *awesome*[^design] designs of this website, feel free to check it out.

[^design]: I wanted something very minimalistic so I explicitly didn't use any themes. I got some inspiration from the [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com). If you don't know that website, I recommend checking it out.
