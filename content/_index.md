Hello there :wave:

I'm Noah Peeters, a remote iOS developer living in a community housing project on an old farm near Rendsburg.

In my blog, I write about programming, mathematics, and other topics that interest me.
On <a rel="me" href="https://troet.cafe/@nono">Mastodon</a>, you can find me as @nono.

### [Source Code](https://github.com/NoahPeeters/noahpeeters.de)

I created this webpage using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and published the source code on GitHub. In case you want to reuse any of the *awesome*[^design] designs of this website, feel free to check it out.

[^design]: I wanted something very minimalistic so I explicitly didn't use any themes. I got some inspiration from the [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com). If you don't know that website, I recommend checking it out.
