### Transfer paper

As part of my bachelors degree at the (Nordakademie)[https://nordakademie.de], I had to write six so-called "Transferleistungen" or "Transfer Papers" -- about one in each semester. Each paper had to be about 10 pages long and had the goal to connect the theroy learned in the lectures with the practical experience from the partner company.
