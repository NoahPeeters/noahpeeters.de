During the time I experimented with python, I created a package to work with math expressions I -- creatively -- called *PyMathExpressions*. It is the only python package I've ever published.

At that time, I didn't know anything about parsers or how to create them. So this project was a fun way to expore them.

An important disclaimer: I wouldn't recommend using this package in a projects.
