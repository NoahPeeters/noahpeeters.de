title: "Projects"

During the last years, I worked on *a lot* of small and personal projects. While these projects were mostly insignificant for others, working on them tought me a lot and helped me become the person I am today.

Most of my projects are lost in the void of forgotton hard drives. Sometimes, when I remember one of my very old projects, I'm a bit sad that I don't have them anymore. Not that I would need them or would reuse parts of them. Most of them were from a time before I know anything about *software quality*. But I'm interested at how I approached solving issues back then. Just to see where I started and where I am now.

That being sad, I collected some of my projects below. I also included projects I worked on for work.
